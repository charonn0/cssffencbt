The		destructor is surely called as long as it's not stored in		a non-local variable.				Besides this, it also implements the ZipProgressNotifier		interface to receive the progress events.	#tag EndNote	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected doCompress As Boolean	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected zar As ZipArchive	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected dest As FolderItem	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected followAliases As Boolean	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected mb_mode As Integer	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected encoding As TextEncoding	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected source() As FolderItem	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected decodeMacBinary As Boolean	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected finished As Double	#tag EndProperty	#tag Property, Flags = &h1		Protected total As Double	#tag EndProperty	#tag ViewBehavior		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Name"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Thread"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Index"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Thread"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Super"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Thread"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Left"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InheritedFrom="Thread"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Top"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InheritedFrom="Thread"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Priority"			Visible=true			Group="Behavior"			InitialValue="5"			Type="Integer"			InheritedFrom="Thread"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="StackSize"			Visible=true			Group="Behavior"			InitialValue="0"			Type="Integer"			InheritedFrom="Thread"		#tag EndViewProperty	#tag EndViewBehaviorEnd Class#tag EndClass
